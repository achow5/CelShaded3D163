Final Group Project CMPM 163\
Stylized Cel-shading in a 3D Environment
---
**Andrew Chow**\
**Nick Gleason**\
**Daniel Vu**

Our idea is to have two 3D models and use a stylized shader in order to make them appear cel-shaded. The concept of applying the iconic shading style usually used in 2D animation and having it work with the flexibility of 3D models seems like a valuable asset for both this project and future works.

**What we did:**\
**Andrew**: Placed and posed the models to be used for the scene and set up the skeleton for the project code. (Model created by Luciano Munoz for a previous course)\
**Nick**: Found the cel-shading material MeshToonMaterial that would be used to give the cartoon shading effect to the models and created a rotating skybox that is displayed in the background.\
**Daniel**: Found the outlining effect that would be used to give a bold black outline to the models and programmed the keyboard buttons X and C to switch between cel-shading and phong-shading.
